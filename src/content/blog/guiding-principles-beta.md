<p>Every day I make dozens of small decisions about what I think constitutes excellent nonprofit journalism. We all do. Editors, writers, readers, all of us. We decide what work we value with our time. What we ignore.</p>
<p>In that decision-making, we prioritize some principles over others. I prioritize journalism that is:&nbsp;<a href="#useful">useful</a>, <a href="#informative">informative</a>, and <a href="#responsive">responsive</a>. Luckily, this work can also create new fundraising opportunities.</p>
<!--break-->
<p><strong><a id="useful" name="useful"></a>Useful</strong></p>
<ul class="rteindent1">
<li>
Do journalism that gives readers information they need. The content is offered in the format that best suits readers&#39; needs and best suits that type of information.</li>
<li>
Offer information in a way that is easy to understand and use.</li>
<li>
Connect readers directly with existing resources, scholarship, and reporting, rather than replicating that work.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a id="informative" name="informative"></a>Informative</strong></p>
<ul class="rteindent1"><li>Offer analysis, data, insight, and commentary that builds on and&nbsp;goes beyond what&nbsp;is available from other publications. A depth of knowledge allows us to offer context and explanation that may be missing from other reporting.</li>
<li>
Cover issues that other publications do not cover.&nbsp;</li>
<li>
Prioritize reporting that is impactful within the communities we cover and in broader policy discussions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a id="responsive" name="responsive"></a>Responsive</strong></p>
<ul class="rteindent1"><li>Listen. Answer questions. Create ways to find out who our audience is, what they need and want, and how they use information.&nbsp;</li>
<li>
Give readers multiple ways and platforms to engage with us and each other, and share information.</li>
<li>
Be&nbsp;<a href="http://erikaowens.com/blog/tech-and-journalism-together">nimble</a>. Be able to respond quickly to suggestions and new information.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<div>These guiding principles can also create fundraising opportunities:</div>
<ul class="rteindent1">
<li>
Events allow readers to engage with topics in a new way, and sponsorships are a possible funding stream. Repackaging archive content is another&nbsp;way to share content,&nbsp;and could be <a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/how_the_new_yorker_monetizes_o.php">underwritten</a>.</li>
<li>
Depth of knowledge is a commodity. Traditional publishing activities are not the only way to share it. We could explore offering research, social media, and other expertise to other organizations.</li>
<li>
As readers are more <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mthomps00/the-brand-is-dead-long-live-the-brand">engaged</a>, they have more opportunities to connect with the organization in new ways. And that <a href="http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reports/article/102622/Community-A-New-Business-Model-for-News.aspx">engagement can grow</a> to membership, donations, and other types of support and volunteering.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feedback very welcome both on the principles themselves and how to guide excellent work in an industry with <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/publications/getting-local-how-nonprofit-news-ventures-seek-sus">limited resources</a> and, often, with a lack of <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/11/the-jekyll-and-hyde-problem-what-are-journalists-and-their-institutions-for/">clarity and vision</a>.</p>
