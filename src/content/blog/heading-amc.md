<p>I am so excited to be heading back to the <a href="https://www.alliedmedia.org/amc">Allied Media Conference</a> this year. And not just that, but I get to <a href="http://amc2015.alliedmedia.org/event/68a6ed6b3a18b27199208312f19dcaaa">facilitate a session</a> with Knight-Mozilla Fellow alum Gabriela Rodriguez while two of our current fellows Tara Adiseshan and Francis Tseng facilitate a <a href="http://amc2015.alliedmedia.org/event/e19dbd9ee221674b2104ab606ae8f9c3">session of their own</a>.</p>

<p>I have only been to the AMC once before, but I&#39;ve been wanting to get back ever since. Personally, it was an experience where I built relationships with activists in Philly during a long car ride, learned about political perspectives I never encountered in college, saw amazing art in museums and on buildings throughout Detroit, and generally had my assumptions and comfortable resting places challenged. It was the first time I had been to a conference that had personal <em>and</em> professional significance. Since then, I&#39;ve encountered hints of the AMC spirit, such as from events with <a href="https://aspirationtech.org/">Aspiration Tech</a>, who are facilitating the <a href="https://amccommtech.wordpress.com/about-2/">community technology network gathering</a> on Thursday.</p>
<p>As my professional and personal work has continued at the intersection of media, technology, community, and activism, I&#39;ve longed to return to the AMC. But the timing hasn&#39;t worked out. Till this year.&nbsp; I am able to attend, and I won&#39;t be there alone. I&#39;m again carpooling with a couple of friends and will be joined by inspiring colleagues. I know that there is a huge amount of overlap between the activism and tech work that many AMC participants are involved with and the work we do at OpenNews. I know there are some amazing <a href="http://opennews.org/what/fellowships/info">Knight-Mozilla Fellowship candidates</a> in the crowd and I cannot wait to chat with them. (Please do say hi or <a href="http://twitter.com/erika_owens">ping me on Twitter</a> if you want to chat.)</p>
<p>It&#39;s already clear that the community technology network gathering will be a highlight. The <a href="https://amccommtech.wordpress.com/agenda/">agenda makes it clear</a> we&#39;ll have the time and space to talk through how our work in tech affects us as individuals and within the communities we serve. The <a href="https://www.alliedmedia.org/amc/community-technology-network-gathering">coordinators</a> of the gathering include folks who have spent years leading open source community efforts and the chatter I&#39;ve seen on Twitter has shown participants will have a lot to teach and learn from each other. It also appears that the agenda has been evolving a bit over the past few days--I love being able to learn from how organizers put together a schedule, choose activities, and the big (and small) decisions that go into creating a safe, supportive space that encourages open dialog. I&#39;m confident the network gathering and AMC as a whole will be such a space.</p>
<p>And so I get to spend a weekend immersed in an activist world, talking about my favorite subjects, and even facilitating a panel about one of them--you guessed it--journalism technology. Then, a few days later, I get to take all that I learn at the AMC and apply it to helping run our own conference, <a href="http://srccon.org">SRCCON</a>. It&#39;s going to be a busy week in the midwest. I can&#39;t wait.</p>
