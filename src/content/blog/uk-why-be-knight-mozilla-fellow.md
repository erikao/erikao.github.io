<p>This week, in the midst of Olympics excitement, The Guardian and BBC described what it&#39;s like to host a <a href="http://www.mozillaopennews.org/fellowships">Knight-Mozilla OpenNews fellow</a> and encouraged you <a href="http://mozillaopennews.org/fellowships/apply.html">to apply to join them</a> or one of six other news organizations as a 2013 Knight-Mozilla Fellow.</p>
<p>The Guardian <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/developer-blog/interactive/2012/aug/01/knight-mozilla-fellowship-guardian-interactive">posted a video</a> featuring current fellow Nicola Hughes talking about what it&#39;s been like working on the Guardian&#39;s interactive team. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2012/07/applications_open_for_knight-m.html">At the BBC</a>, there will be major changes in 2013 and&nbsp;Andrew Leimdorfer detailed how their Knight-Mozilla Fellow will be involved.</p>
