title: 'Why nonprofit news? Community.'

<p>What <em>is </em>the deal with the nonprofit news model? I think about this a lot and have plenty of different answers, but in considering it recently, my first reaction was emotional: It&#39;s about being a part of a community.</p>

The most talked about paper was probably the Chilton school newspaper (I kid, I kid). We read the local paper (I delivered it for four years) and watched the news, but life was not organized around the news cycle.</p>
<p>Life was organized around the election cycle.</p>

<p>Since before I can remember, my mom volunteered on political campaigns. We&#39;d go with her doing door-to-door canvassing. I loved it. I thought my life would always be organized around campaign work.</p>
<p>But then in 2008, I stuck with nonprofit news. I was already a part of <a href="http://www.thenotebook.org">something great</a> that I believed in and I could see doing good--a lot of the same things that interested me in electoral politics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best part of canvassing is the conversations, the immediacy of the connection with the person at the door. Being part of a nonprofit can build a similarly strong connection.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the&nbsp;<em>Notebook</em>​ held its second happy hour to celebrate the release of the print edition of the paper. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150657911700973.446341.42287300972&amp;type=3">Dozens of people attended</a>, chatted about the paper and their favorite comment threads on recent blog posts, and just had a fun, relaxed time. I really felt a sense of community. One of the most amazing things about our website has been the development of a community in the comments of our site. It&#39;s been great to take that connection a step further to in-person meetups, and increasingly to people <a href="http://www.thenotebook.org/join-us">joining a membership program</a>.</p>
<p>I love when I am able to directly support and engage with organizations I care about, and it&#39;s been amazing to have more than 500 people join the&nbsp;<em>Notebook</em>​ to do that as members. When I think about institutions I&#39;ve valued, from radio stations and magazines to community organizing groups and advocacy organizations, I feel most engaged when I can support the group and join its community. Some for-profit companies I&#39;ve really liked (R.I.P. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WOXY.com">WOXY</a>) have closed down, and I never had the chance to help. With nonprofits, I can support the community as early, often, and with as much money and time as I am able. I&#39;m not limited to a subscription fee.</p>
<p>I&#39;m grateful that nonprofit organizations offer a way to engage with a community and support great journalism.</p>
