<p>This year there&#39;s a new feature at the Online News Association conference, <a href="http://themidway.tumblr.com/">The Midway</a>. After people took to the halls last year to have unconference sessions, ONA organizers decided to create a space for discussion and learning about new projects. At 2:15 p.m. on Friday, I will be there to chat about the just-announced&nbsp;<a href="http://mozillaopennews.org/codesprints.html">Code Sprints</a> and OpenNews generally, including the big news of an <a href="http://ekprojectlog.tumblr.com/post/31921707575/source-launches-october-16th">official launch date for Source</a>: October 16!</p>

<p>At last year&#39;s conference,&nbsp;OpenNews&nbsp;director Dan Sinker led a post-lunch <a href="http://ona11.journalists.org/sessions/knight-mozilla-open-source-newsroom/">keynote about open source in the newsroom</a>. After a rebranding of the project and a year of incredible work, there&#39;s a lot of news to share about OpenNews. More than that, Code Sprints and Source are both focused on strengthening, and helping to expand, the community of news developers. Code Sprints are designed to solve real problems in newsrooms and I&#39;m interested in talking with folks, particularly from smaller news organizations, about project ideas for the program. For people already working on awesome projects, Source is a fabulous opportunity to share lessons and suggestions with the broader news development community. I look forward to meeting folks who have pieces they&#39;d like to contribute or suggestions of types of posts they&#39;d find most useful.</p>
<p>TechRaking II, Hacks/Hackers Hacking @ ONA, The Midway, it&#39;s a whirlwind trip to the Bay Area. So, let&#39;s take this opportunity to chat in person, or we might just have to catch up <a href="http://mozillafestival.org/">in London</a>.</p>
