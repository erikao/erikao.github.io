I once tried to write a travel diary and it was the most boring writing I've ever seen in my life. Hopefully this won't be <em>quite</em> so bad.

In just over a month, I will be moving from the US to the UK. I realized it might be useful to document some parts of this process like:
<ul><li>getting a visa</li>
<li>getting ready socially</li>
<li>oh my gosh, all the life admin stuff</li>
<li>moving an 18-year-old cat across an ocean (some of the <a href="https://www.wheelingit.us/2018/03/09/moving-to-europe-v-pet-transport-options-by-sea-by-air-pet-carriers-more/">existing documentation</a> pointed us in the direction of taking the cat over on a boat)</li>
<li>how the hell you pack your stuff to take it on a boat</li>
<li>how the hell you decide what, of the absurd amount of random things people have bought you and you yourself have accumulated over several decades, you actually take to another country</li>
<li>and probably other, maybe even emotional (gasp) things about moving for the first time in nearly twenty years</li></ul>

Part of my preparation (/procrastination) appears to be re-watching both Slow Horses and Industry, and enjoying the Paralympics! We'll see how this goes.
