And, wow, as of right now 34 people are RSVPed. That&#39;s incredible! It speaks to the need for a group to help connect the vibrant technology and journalism communities doing amazing work in Philadelphia, but largely working separately.</p>

<p>For the first meetup, we plan to have time for people to get to know one another, learn about Hacks/Hackers, and discuss how the group would like to see the chapter take shape. Do we want to <a href="http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/2011/09/02/show-your-work/">build apps</a>? Skillshare? <a href="http://meetup.bostonpython.com/events/34664362/?eventId=34664362&amp;action=detail">Project night</a>? There are some great existing projects like <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/">OpenDataPhilly</a> that could serve as a starting point for collaboration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My experience at the <a href="http://hackshackers.com/blog/2011/09/24/hacks-hackers-hacking-at-ona11-recap/">Hacks/Hackers hackathon before the Online News Association conference</a> really served as a proof of concept for the amazing work this organization can do. Within just a few hours, teams of techies and journos&nbsp;built <a href="http://bit.ly/charttool">real tools</a> (or made significant progress on them).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/HacksHackersPhilly/events/34955492/">first meetup</a> is Tuesday, October 18 from 6-8 p.m. on the 16th floor of the Municipal Services Building at 1417 JFK Blvd.</p>
