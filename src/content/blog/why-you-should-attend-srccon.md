After seeing how well small group conversations and collaboration can<a href="/blog/journalism-presence-mozfest-grows"> work at the Mozilla Festival</a>, we knew we had to bring that experience stateside. And bonus, it&#39;s in Philly.</p>
<p>SRCCON is designed to be a place for developers, interactive designers, and others who love to code in and near newsrooms to build and create together. But since it&#39;s the first time this event is happening, it might take a little convincing to get the time off work to attend. So here&#39;s some thoughts about why you (and your boss) should be excited about your participation in SRCCON.</p>
<ul class="rteindent1">
<li>
<p><strong>The conference is going to be small.</strong> 125 people, that&#39;s it. As such, it&#39;s geared to lots and lots of <a href="http://srccon.org/sessions/proposals/">small group conversations and workshops</a>, which means <em>you</em> get to dictate what you want to talk about and take away from the event. If there&#39;s a question your newsroom is really struggling with, discuss it at SRCCON. If there&#39;s a project you are super excited about, discuss it at SRCCON.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Related, other people are going to want to discuss these same concerns and when you talk from you&#39;re experience they&#39;ll remember &quot;oh yeah, [your name and org] grappled with that too and they learned X.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The conference is not an isolated event. </strong>It&#39;s part of a <a href="/blog/celebrating-investment-opennews-and-journalism-code-community">community ecosystem</a>. As such, it will likely give you concrete next steps, whether it be other speaking opportunities, writing opportunities, connections with peers at newsrooms (and the possibility of support for something you want to work on together, like during a <a href="https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/learned-first-convening/">code convening</a>), or training opportunities. It&#39;s connected with OpenNews&#39; other work (which you and other folks in the community shape) and it is meant to make it easier for you to directly connect with other folks and organizations too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>We&#39;ve got your back and want you to be there.</strong> Erin Kissane put a lot of effort in the <a href="http://srccon.org/conduct">code of conduct</a> for the event to make explicit what our expectations are for participation and what we will do if anyone feels unsafe. It&#39;s really important to us that SRCCON be accessible and open to anyone who would like to attend. We&#39;ve set up a <a href="http://srccon.org/scholarships">travel scholarship</a> and put a lot of effort into outreach to help make sure the conference reflects the diversity of the communities we serve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>And, in bottom line fashion: it&#39;s affordable.</strong> Tickets are $150 and cover you for two days, a couple meals, and snacks. It&#39;s also happening in Philadelphia, which is a not expensive by big-city standards. $2 slices of pizza are right around the corner from the venue, as are <a href="http://srccon.org/logistics">many other diversions</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you&#39;re convinced, <a href="http://srccon.org/register">pick up a ticket</a>. And please, once you have, help us spread the word. Can&#39;t wait to see this community in person, and have the chance to show everyone what makes Philly such an exciting city for journalism, technology, and civic hacking.</p>
