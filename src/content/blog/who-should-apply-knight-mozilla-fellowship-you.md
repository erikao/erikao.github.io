<span class="author-g-7hyfx65b0lb2brpw">Yes, yes it could. <a href="http://opennews.org/fellowships/apply.html">If you apply</a>. We often get asked &quot;what makes an ideal applicant?&quot; Over the past three years, we&#39;ve found that what sets a candidate apart is evidence that, as OpenNews Director Dan Sinker puts it, they are a &quot;creative problem solver.&quot; This means, you&#39;re someone who enjoys solving problems through code--whether that be with a captivating design testing the limits of your JavaScript skills or with writing a python script to parse a giant data set or with programming an arduino to monitor what the hell is happening in the back of your fridge.</span> :o)</div>

<div id="magicdomid10">
<span class="author-g-7hyfx65b0lb2brpw">We look for people who show a curiosity about the world around them--a key trait shared with journalists--and who turn to code to help answer the questions that arise. There is no single path to acquire the skills to be able to solve problems in this way. A </span><span class="author-g-kgmb9ratqejoognc">few </span><span class="author-g-7hyfx65b0lb2brpw">of our fellows studied computer science in college, but most didn&#39;t. Some have worked in software development, but some came from universities. Some have worked in journalism before, but most became immersed in journalism through the fellowship.</span></div>

<span class="author-g-7hyfx65b0lb2brpw">The way we get to know you, future applicant, is through <a href="http://opennews.org/fellowships/apply.html">the short application form</a>. We say there are no trick questions and we mean it. This application is a chance to get to know, as much as is possible in a few questions, how you think, how you approach problems, the role you&#39;ve played on prior projects. I promise, there is no &quot;right&quot; answer to any of these questions, it&#39;s whatever reflects you, your work, and your interest in applying your skills to journalism.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div id="magicdomid16">
<span class="author-g-7hyfx65b0lb2brpw">If a question has you stumped--<a href="mailto:info@opennews.org">email us</a>. We&#39;re here to help. For example, not everyone has an active GitHub account. Some people have worked (so far!) on proprietary code they cannot share publicly. We understand this and that&#39;s why we have an upload field for you to add a screenshot, wireframe, something to help us understand your project. We don&#39;t want any of the questions to get in the way of you applying--the application is just to ease the info transfer of your awesomeness into our review forms. If something&#39;s getting in the way of that, just shout. And if you&#39;re unsure of your own awesomeness, check out what <a href="http://veltman.tumblr.com/post/56132893301/code-the-newsroom-and-self-doubt">Noah</a> and <span class="author-g-7hyfx65b0lb2brpw"><a href="http://aureliamoser.com/2014/08/05/parallax-effects-modern-map-moving-in-interactive-news/">Aurelia</a> </span> have to say about that.</span></div>
