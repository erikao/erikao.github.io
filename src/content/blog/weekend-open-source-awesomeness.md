<p>Whew. Busy weekend of some excellent learning and sharing opportunities.&nbsp;I&#39;ll be presenting a session about <a href="http://www.drupaldelphia.com/sessions/civicrm-nonprofits">CiviCRM for nonprofits</a> again this year at Drupaldelphia. Feedback welcome on helpful Civi stuff to cover. And, I&#39;ll be an instructor at the PyStar Philly class. Look forward to learning and connecting with folks!</p>
