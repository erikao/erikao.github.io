title: I've got some news

<p>Sometimes I like to shout things at inanimate objects. The TV. My computer. Cars that are trying to kill me while I'm biking or are just parked halfway into the road. You know.</p><p> 

When I saw that the <a href="http://mozillaopennews.org">Knight-Mozilla OpenNews project</a> was hiring a Community Manager, I shouted at my computer <a href="http://sinker.tumblr.com/post/22591598928/work-at-opennews-were-hiring-a-community-manager">"that's me!"</a> </p><p>And, turns out, it is me. It actually is. I signed the papers this week and will be starting with Mozilla next month as the OpenNews Community Manager. I am beyond elated and cannot wait to start working full-time supporting this incredibly inspiring community around journalism and code.
</p><p> 
I'm sad to be leaving the <a href="http://thenotebook.org"><em>Philadelphia Public School Notebook</em></a>, but I'm so grateful that I had the chance to learn so much during my nearly five years with the <em>Notebook</em>. To learn about journalism and open source and community engagement and nonprofits and education policy and so much more. I'm also extremely appreciative of what I've learned from, and the relationships I've built with, amazingly talented colleagues, bloggers, volunteers, interns, and our devoted and opinionated readers.

<a href="/blog/weekend-open-source-awesomeness">Today</a> really encompasses what lead me to this "dream job" that's better than I could have dreamed. I spoke at Drupaldelphia this morning about CiviCRM. Redesigning the <em>Notebook</em>'s website in Drupal is what first got me involved in the open source community and allowed me to feel more comfortable talking about technology. And this evening, I'll be an instructor at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/phillypug/events/63291352/">PyStar Philly</a>, where I learned python a year ago and chatted with PyStar Philly founder Dana Bauer. Dana suggested we start a chapter of <a href="http://hackshackers.com">Hacks/Hackers</a> in Philly. I cannot thank Dana enough for inviting me to start <a href="http://meetup.com/hackshackersphilly">that chapter</a> with her.</p><p> Building connections, learning to program, going to many many meetups &ndash; these activities lead me to today, and to this new job. Also, let's be clear, <a href="/blog/launch-hackshackers-philly">Philly's a big part of it, too</a>. Philly has robust tech and journalism communities that make it possible to collaborate and contribute in meaningful ways.
</p><p> 
I'm starting with OpenNews July 9. I get to stay in Philly. I'm giddy. I probably want to talk to you. Get in touch, or I'll be contacting you soon. I'm humbled to be joining the brilliant folks who are working with this awesome project. Can't wait to get started. </p>
