title: 'Major news for CiviCRM'

<p>The <a href="http://civicrm.org/blogs/yashodha/civicrm-v41-beta1-released">new version of CiviCRM</a> includes support for Drupal 6 <em>and</em> 7, and for the first time, WordPress.The version is still in beta, but continued support for Drupal 6 is an enormous relief.</p>
<p>Just a few months ago a <a href="http://civicrm.org/blogs/lobo/make-it-happen-extend-support-drupal-6-and-joomla-15-dec-2011">make it happen project</a> extended support for updates for Drupal 6 through March 2012. Even that extension would have required us to upgrade our Drupal 6 site immediately. For us, and &nbsp;many other small nonprofit clients who love and rely on CiviCRM, a required upgrade right away would have been extremely difficult. Heck, some organizations are just moving from Drupal 5, and the much-delayed release of Drupal 7 made it difficult to plan when to do an upgrade anyway.</p>
<p>Whew, I&#39;m so grateful to our CiviCRM consultant, <a href="http://aghstrategies.com/">Amanda Hunt</a>, for pointing this out to me today. I totally missed it in all the year end busyness.</p>
<p>I realize that the WordPress support is probably the bigger story for many people. It will certainly help with the South Philly Food Co-op. As a Drupal partisan it makes me a little sad though--the fact that CiviCRM was limited to Drupal (and Joomla) was a major point in weighing it against WordPress. That&#39;s no longer. But, pursuing WordPress integration is part of what allowed longer term support for Drupal 6, so I&#39;m appreciative for that.</p>
<p>Viva open-source community collaboration!</p>
