<p>This Saturday is the annual <a href="http://bcniphilly.com">BarCamp News Innovation</a> event at Temple University. This year, I&#39;ll be participating as a <a href="http://bcniphilly.com/2012/04/21/why-and-how-the-open-gov-news-hackathon-is-being-judged-3000-in-prizes/">judge of the Open Gov &quot;News&quot; Hackathon</a>. I appreciate being asked to judge the hackathon and look forward to seeing what awesome mobile tools the teams of coders and journalists conjure up Saturday.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been to BCNI&nbsp;for a few years, and it&#39;s always been a great chance to learn and catch up with folks. In particular, it&#39;s been a way to see how much of a leader Philadelphia is in the news innovation community. People from up and down the East Coast (and sometimes farther!) come to Philly. We get to learn together, and Philly gets a chance to showcase the variety of nonprofit, community-based, ethnic, traditional, and other journalism efforts that it supports.</p>
<p>Last year was the first year that a <a href="http://bcniphilly.com/2011/05/09/bcni-2011-open-gov-hackathon-results-and-prizes/">hackathon&nbsp;was part of BCNI</a>. Even within the past year, the hackathon&nbsp;space in Philly has grown a ton, and there&#39;s now a chapter of Hacks/Hackers that is specifically devoted to bringing together techies and journalists. Coupled with the support of the <a href="http://bcniphilly.com/2012/04/21/dan-schultz-of-truthgoggles-and-amy-gahran-of-oaklandlocal-com-2012-attendee-highlight/">Center for Public Interest Journalism in helping foster community engagement through mobile tools</a>, this year&#39;s hackathon is well positioned to continue growing in the number and types of projects. Plus, Random Hacks of Kindness is coming up in June, a perfect opportunity for teams to spend more time working on projects they begin this weekend.</p>
<p>Hacks/Hackers Philly will be announcing details of our May meetup at BCNI tomorrow. I look forward to seeing how the unconference and hackathon seed ideas and connections between the two events, and the wealth of skills and enthusiasm in both spheres.</p>
