<p><img alt="Dino" src="/files/dino-book.jpg" style="width: 200px; float: left; margin-right: 5px; height: 200px;" />In the same way that all kids love dinosaurs, I think everyone spends at least some portion of life loving words. Whether it be their commandment power over parents that is more effective than vague crying or the aggressive quality when wielded against classmates or the way a well-written assignment could earn the admiration of teachers or the transporting power of a psychedelic school bus. Some of us then become paleontologists and writers, while others of us take photos of animatronic dinosaurs at museums and aspirationally list &quot;writer&quot; as occupation on their passport.<br />

I turn 30 on December 12 of next year. Often, people set 30 as the age to meet some goal. Usually, it&#39;s a goal that requires other people--make a million dollars, get married, have a baby. I didn&#39;t want to do that. I wanted to pick a goal that I could achieve myself. So I&#39;m going to publish a zine before I turn 30. I&#39;m twice the age I should have been to write a zine, but I didn&#39;t know about them in high school and I think this is a good way to finally make it happen. And I can use some tips and inspiration. For my birthday this year I&#39;d appreciate your help.<br />
<br />
What is a story that blows you away? What reward (or punishment) helps you power through writer&#39;s block and get those words on the page? What helps you write? What do you appreciate in the work that other people do? I know, there&#39;s entire sections of book stores devoted to this stuff. But, just share one silly, stupid, wonderful, awful thing that matters to you. Thanks for your time and for helping me become a (better) writer and get to know you (better).<br />
<br />
Also: I value your suggestions, but it <em>is</em> the season of giving. For each person who contributes a suggestion (you may do so anonymously), I will donate $5 to a literacy organization (to a max of $300). I have some organizations in mind, but thoughts welcome on that as well. Thanks.</p>


(Edited to add: this post actually got a bunch of comments unlike was usual on the old version of this site! It is a bit hard to export comments in any usable way, so I did a few screenshots to approximate this. I also saved the text so if you need it for screen reader purposes, <a href="mailto:hello@erikaowens.com">let me know</a>. I just need to figure out how to copy and paste it in a way that will actually be comprehensible in alt text and not just a mess of comment styling!)
