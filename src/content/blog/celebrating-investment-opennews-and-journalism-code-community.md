<p>Today the Knight Foundation <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/press-room/press-release/knight-mozilla-effort-foster-newsroom-innovation-4/">announced its renewed commitment to Knight-Mozilla OpenNews</a>, with a $4 million grant. That&#39;s a whole lotta money. Big news. It&#39;s an investment not in a product, but in a <em>community</em>.<br />
<br />
Earlier this year, the CEO of the Knight Foundation publicly <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/06/opening-up-government-a-new-round-of-knight-news-challenge-winners-aims-to-get-citizens-and-governments-better-information/">asked for feedback about the Knight News Challenge</a> and how to help their grantmaking have more impact. If I may be so bold: this is it. OpenNews <a href="http://dansinker.com/post/64293813605/opennews-ascent-stage">has plans to build some amazing stuff</a>, but more than that, this project is about acting as the connective tissue in the journalism code community. It exists <a href="http://opennews.org/getinvolved.html">to meet people</a> <em>where they are already at</em> and support them in deepening their engagement, their skills, and their leadership in this community. It&#39;s rare that an organization has the chance to focus on building connections between people, institutions, and projects. But that&#39;s how we get to spend the next three years.</p>

<p>Journalism isn&#39;t the only industry plagued by silos and duplicative work. During editorial board meetings with <a href="http://thenotebook.org">the <em>Notebook</em></a>, it came up time and time again that programs had been tried in schools only to be abruptly canceled, whether they showed positive results or not. A new administration would take over and the cycle would start again - test idea, kill idea, forget idea happened. It was just so clear that it shouldn&#39;t have to be that way. There should be some way for programs to be tracked, supported, given room to thrive or fail, and when they worked, be replicated.<br />
<br />
It seemed so simple.<br />
<br />
But in an environment of overworked staff and underfunded institutions (sound familiar?) it&#39;s hard to find the time to think beyond the day to day, nevermind to take a step back and plan, organize, and implement longer view plans. OpenNews has been given the resources it needs to play that eagle-eye role in the journalism code community. With the luxuries of time, money, skilled staff, and a highly engaged, international community, OpenNews has the opportunity to show what can happen when you invest in community, in building connections, in supporting the development of leaders.<br />
<br />
I just <a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/sessions/hosting-a-journo-hack-day">gave a session</a> at the Online News Association conference <a href="/files/journohackdaysONA2013.pdf">about journalism hack days</a>, one of the areas of community support we&#39;ll be able to continue and expand with this grant. It was a chance to share some of the amazing examples of what <a href="http://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/chat-john-keefe/">hack days</a> <a href="/files/presenta-timeline-HHBA2013-curvas2.pdf">can create</a> as well as the cultural change it can foster. Several people in the session were interested in <a href="https://github.com/erikao/journohackdays">planning hack days</a> and were eager to learn more about how to build energy and interest in journalism hacking. We&#39;ve already supported hack days <a href="/files/hackdays-map.jpg">all over the world</a>, and I&#39;m looking forward to helping even more people plan events in their local community that offer opportunities for creating connections and code that will ensure journalism thrives on the web.</p>
<p>I&#39;m tremendously excited about the next three years. We&#39;re gonna do intensive evaluation into our work and share it back to the journalism community, and I hope, the nonprofit community more broadly as well. It&#39;s rare to get the chance to do something new, necessary, and that you know has the power to improve how we support vital civic institutions. I&#39;m awed. I&#39;m ready. Let&#39;s show what ground-up community support can do for journalism.</p>
