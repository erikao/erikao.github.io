<p>Thank you to everyone who came out to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/HacksHackersPhilly/events/34955492/">first Hacks/Hackers Philly meetup</a>! Over 30 people attended, and according to the sign-in sheet the hack/hacker distribution was roughly half/half. Great to see a mix of backgrounds and interests.</p>
<p>As promised, this blog post will give a recap of the meeting and describe our immediate next steps. We began the meeting with an overview of why we wanted to start a chapter, and then discussed what topics and meeting types would be of interest to everyone. Right away we even discussed a tool, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-refine">Google Refine</a>, that was new to some of us, and at least for me, was immediately useful to my work.</p>
<h3>Why do we want to start a chapter of Hacks/Hackers?</h3>
<p><a href="http://hackshackers.com/about/history/">Two years ago</a>, people interested in both journalism and technology started Hacks/Hackers. Since then, chapters have started in cities all over the world where journalists and techies&nbsp;know they have a lot to learn from and teach one another. Philly has companies doing amazing work in technology and in journalism, which is a great starting point to help those groups work together more in our city.</p>
<p>Also, we wanted to create a space where people with a variety of skill levels and backgrounds feel comfortable. It can be intimidating to go to a meetup for a topic targeted at a single group. We hope this organization can appeal to people from the tech and journalism camps, people in between the two, and any other interested observers.</p>
<p>Increasingly, news organizations are understanding the need to bring developers directly into the content creation process. News outlets like the <a href="http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/2011/09/02/show-your-work/"><em>Chicago Tribune</em></a> and <a href="http://www.propublica.org/tools/"><em>ProPublica </em></a>have teams devoted to developing news apps and they publicly share their work. Projects like <a href="http://www.propublica.org/tools/">OpenDataPhilly</a>&nbsp;are helping increase access to data. Journalists need help sorting through that data and displaying it in an accessible way. Many of the projects funded by the <a href="http://knightfoundation.org/funding-initiatives/knight-news-challenge/">Knight News Challenge</a> (which <a href="http://knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2010/11/9/open-source-requirements-of-the-knight-news-challenge/">requires its projects to be open source</a>) are focused on how to better handle data. The foundation recently announced it will hold three grant cycles a year <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/romenesko/149673/knight-news-challenge-to-hold-three-contests-a-year-to-keep-up-with-pace-of-innovation/">because &quot;the innovation cycle is so short.&quot;</a></p>
<h3>Why Philly?</h3>
<p>Philadelphia is already showing the possibilities of collaboration across fields. A group of partners from several sectors, Azavea, the City of Philadelphia&#39;s Office of Technology,&nbsp;NPower&nbsp;PA,&nbsp;<em>Technically Philly</em>,&nbsp;<em>WHYY</em>, and the William Penn Foundation, supports OpenDataPhilly. The <a href="http://www.j-lab.org/projects/enterprise-reporting-fund">Enterprise Reporting Fund</a> gave $5,000 grants to projects between old school and new media journalists and nonprofits. For the second year, Philly will be a <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/philadelphia/">Code For America city</a>, and the first year fellows&#39; project is seeking to <a href="http://philly.changeby.us/#start">engage community members</a> in civic action.</p>
<p>Innovation is already happening here. We are showing what is possible through collaboration, and the city and major foundations are supportive of this work. The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ONA-Philly/">Philly chapter of the Online News Association</a> is also providing a space for journalists to gather and learn from one another about some of those projects, including&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/ONA-Philly/events/30059701/"><em>WHYY</em>&#39;s <em>NewsWorks</em></a> and the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ONA-Philly/events/37674452/">Philadelphia Media Network&#39;s tablet initiative</a>.</p>
<p>I will be writing more about the specific projects that are happening in Philly, what we can learn from other cities, and other possibilities for funding and collaboration.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What next?</h3>
<ul class="rteindent1">
<li>
<p><strong>Resource guide.&nbsp;</strong>There&#39;s a lot of jargon that both hacks and hackers use in their respective spaces. Several people expressed interest in a resource guide to help bridge the vocab gaps, and share already existing tools. I will soon start a wiki and will be gathering resources from existing Hacks/Hackers chapters and other sources. Please feel free to add to it or ask questions!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communication.</strong>​&nbsp;In addition to the Meetup page, I <a href="https://lists.mayfirst.org/mailman/listinfo/hhphl">started a mailing list</a>. We also have a <a href="http://twitter.com/hackshackersphl">Twitter account</a>, which we&#39;ll use to publicize events and share tips and tools of interest. And of course, <a href="http://hackshackers.com">HacksHackers.com</a> has a great blog where we will cross-post updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Skillsharing and project </strong><strong>development.</strong>​&nbsp;Beyond a resource guide, we plan to have in-person explanations of tools and resources. Working together on projects is also a great way to learn and teach. We plan for our next meeting to blend both of these approaches. On November 15, we&#39;ll spend half the time on short talks about tools for dealing with data such as Google Fusion Tables. Then, we&#39;ll brainstorm data-oriented projects that small teams can work on, with an eye to developing the projects at a Random Hacks of Kindness hackathon in early December.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks again to everyone who came to the first meetup and who is interested in the group.</p>
<p>We appreciate your help in creating a welcoming space where people at a variety of skill levels can feel comfortable and able to contribute. After our meetup&nbsp;in November, we are tentatively planning a social event in December, and then another regular meetup in January. We&#39;re really encouraged by the energy and enthusiasm in the group, and please <a href="mailto:philly@hackshackers.com">keep in touch</a> if you have any questions or suggestions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope to see you at the next Hacks/Hackers Philly meetup November 15 at the Municipal Services Building from 6:30-8:30 p.m. or, before that,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/ONA-Philly/events/37674452/">November 2 at ONA Philly&#39;s meetup</a> at the <em>Inquirer</em> building.</p>
