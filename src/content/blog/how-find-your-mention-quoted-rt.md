title: 'How to find your mention in a quoted RT'

<p>Have you ever happened upon a <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2906764/twitters-quote-tweet-revamp-leaves-more-room-for-your-thoughts.html">quote tweet</a> that @ mentioned you, but didn&#39;t show up in your mentions? Did you try everything you could think of to find out whether there were MORE of these tweets?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a solution: search for the URL of the tweet that mentions you, not your username. (h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/sisiwei">Sisi Wei</a>)</p>

<p>When this has happened to me it&#39;s because someone mentions me in a tweet, then someone else quote tweets to reply, rather than replying directly. This means the mention isn&#39;t actually in the text of the tweet, which is what Twitter&#39;s search and notifications crawl. The text that is actually in the tweet is the URL of the original tweet.</p>

<p>I searched a bunch of different search terms and couldn&#39;t find any blog posts explaining how to find these mentions. I finally asked some friends, Sisi suggested searching the URL, and I immediately found three tweets responding to me, but that never made it to my mentions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely cumbersome to search a URL by hand, but it works in a pinch if you know a particular tweet might be generating some conversation. It looks like this data <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/twitter-adds-quoted-tweet-data-to-apis/2015/05/28">is available through the API</a>, so maybe there is a Twitter client that has looped it into its notifications. Or maybe I should build myself a little script.</p>

<p>If you know of an existing tool, please do share. Otherwise, I&#39;ll keep searching the URLs till I find another way.</p>
