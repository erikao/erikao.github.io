<p>ProPublica, already a leader in investigative nonprofit news, announced the <a href="http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/join-the-team-news-applications-fellow">News Applications Fellowship</a> today. This is huge. It is specifically targeted at journalists with an interest in, and facility for, becoming app developers. ProPublica will mentor the fellow and teach him/her how to build apps as a way of testing a hypothesis: &quot;Can a smart, technical journalist with excellent and proven skills in other nerdy newsroom disciplines like graphics and CAR become a news app developer?&quot; I can&#39;t think of another opportunity like this, which is targeted at the journalist side of the hacker-journalist hybrid.</p>
<p>Something that comes up a lot at techie meetups&nbsp;is that it can be difficult for beginners to get a real start in web development.</p>

<p>Once people learn the basics, there are few ways to get over the intermediate hump after the tutorials and introductory classes end, and even fewer opportunities to take programming from a hobby to a career. The Philadelphia Python Users Group is holding its <a href="http://www.meetup.com/phillypug/events/47281392/">first project night</a> this month to try to help people through that intermediate stage. I&#39;m hopeful that if the project night becomes a regular activity, it&#39;ll be a chance for people to collaborate, learn from one another, and have regular mentoring opportunities that will make it more feasible to get hired as an apprentice or junior developer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codeacademy</a> Code Year officially started today. Got my first lesson, and I&#39;m enjoying the super usable in-browser terminal. Half a million people have signed up so far, which is both amazing and not so far-fetched given that it seemed like all of Twitter registered. A public, paced course is a great way to help people build programming skills, and support their friends who are doing the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#39;s been exciting to see all of these learning opportunities develop over the past year, and in Philly in particular, <a href="http://technicallyphilly.com/2011/12/12/women-entrepreneurs-and-technologists-a-growing-community-more-welcomed-here-than-bay-area-other-tech-hubs">groups and classes aimed at women</a> have really thrived. I&#39;m grateful to have been involved in these groups, and to see new connections develop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ProPublica&nbsp;is committed to the &quot;<a href="http://www.propublica.org/nerds">show your work</a>&quot; ethos, and I&#39;m sure documenting the News Apps Fellowship experiment will be no different. Smart newsrooms will starting thinking now about what they can learn from this model. I&#39;m confident that this approach that starts with a skilled journalist will be a success, and will prove to be an effective way to develop enthusiastic, tenacious talent.</p>
