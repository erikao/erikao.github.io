Rather than slide-driven lectures, MozFest sessions are collaborative, interactive, and focused on uncovering new possibilities for what it means to work online, in the open.</span></div>

<span class="author-g-7hyfx65b0lb2brpw">What makes a good journalism or data session?</span></h3>
<div class="ace-line" id="magicdomid411">
<span class="author-g-7hyfx65b0lb2brpw">Journalism drives the web both through content and code, and MozFest sessions reflect that wide range. Data is a part of what helps us understand the world around us, whether that be through visualizations, sensors, or good old fashioned research, MozFest is a place to talk about it. The most important part of a good session is that it is something you are passionate about--whether that be a tool you want to share, a question you want to wrestle with, or a problem you want smart people to help you solve.&nbsp;</span></div>

<span class="author-g-7hyfx65b0lb2brpw">Much like SRCCON, <a href="http://2014.mozillafestival.org/proposal-guidelines/">MozFest session leaders</a> play the role of facilitator rather than lecturer. Participants come ready to be generous with their expertise and time and they are oriented toward next steps and building, not just discussing. Session leaders help create that space by using personal experience as a frame for discussion and prototyping, not the sole focus. The team from Aspiration Tech, who help manage MozFest, also have some <a href="http://facilitation.aspirationtech.org/index.php?title=Main_Page">great guides</a> on <a href="http://facilitation.aspirationtech.org/index.php?title=Facilitation:Break-Outs">break out sessions</a> and <a href="http://facilitation.aspirationtech.org/index.php?title=Facilitation:Facilitator_Guidelines">facilitating</a>. The audience for MozFest is a little different from SRCCON though--1,000 open web lovers rather than 150 news nerds--which means if there&#39;s something you&#39;ve been wanting to share with a broader audience, MozFest is a great place to do it.</span> Also, there are a limited number of travel stipends available for MozFest, so if you&#39;re pitching a session and would require support to attend, <a href="mailto:info@opennews.org">please let us know</a>.</div>
