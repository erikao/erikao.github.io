<p><span>What if going to hackathons were actually part of your job? <a href="http://mozillaopennews.org/fellowships/apply.html">Apply to be a Knight-Mozilla OpenNews fellow</a> and you could spend 10 months traveling the world attending hack days while being anchored with a major newsroom. You&#39;ll get the best of both worlds: a variety of problem types and teammates at the&nbsp; hack days and journalists to work with on longer-term projects at your home newsroom. After 10 months, you&#39;re sure to leave with an expanded skillset, a bursting github account, and some captivating travel stories.</span></p>

<p><span>No one knows what &quot;the future of&nbsp; journalism&quot; will look like, which leaves a lot of room for developers with diverse backgrounds to experiment in shaping that future. Knight-Mozilla OpenNews has partnered with eight leading news organizations to offer <a href="http://mozillaopennews.org/fellowships/">fellowships</a> for developers and technologists who want to&nbsp; make a difference in journalism.

<p><span>The Knight-Mozilla OpenNews project is about growing the community around open development in journalism, and since Mozilla is an international&nbsp; company, that work has worldwide reach. During 2013, <a href="http://mozillaopennews.org/fellowships/">eight OpenNews fellows</a> will be based in newsrooms in New York and Boston, London, Hamburg and Berlin, and Buenos Aires. Fellows will also travel around the world for hack days, conferences, and other events throughout 2013. Be a part of the growing international community working to reshape journalism. <a href="http://mozillaopennews.org/fellowships/apply.html">Apply to be a Knight-Mozilla OpenNews fellow today</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>As media organizations consolidate operations and journalists get arrested for doing their jobs, it is increasingly important to ensure that we have an open, transparent fourth estate. Web developers, designers, and data geeks are playing a major role in opening up data and information in newsrooms and in making stories more accessible and understandable to readers. The <a href="http://mozillaopennews.org/fellowships/">Knight-Mozilla OpenNews fellowship</a> places developers and technologists in newsrooms to work on projects that help citizens become better informed and engaged with their communities. <a href="http://mozillaopennews.org/fellowships/apply.html">Apply by August 11</a> to spend 10 months hacking on journalism projects that hold institutions accountable.</span></p>
