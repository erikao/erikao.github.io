<p>This month&#39;s <a href="http://carnivalofjournalism.com/2012/02/02/what-emerging-technology-or-digital-trend-will-upend-journalism-next-jcarn/">Carnival of Journalism asks</a> what emerging technology will have a major impact on journalism next? Within the setup for this prompt is the answer: People. Changes in leadership and culture is the emerging technology that will allow those amazing new tools and opportunities to be fully utilized.</p>

<p>Host Steve &quot;In&quot; Outing says it himself:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>&quot;Who&rsquo;s to blame? The answer is clear to me: Journalists and those who manage news organizations. Our industry and profession didn&rsquo;t act quickly or aggressively enough to adapt to the way that new technologies would change journalism.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>The conversation about technology and innovation cannot move forward until the &quot;technology&quot; that allows <a href="http://jxpaton.wordpress.com/2012/02/18/old-dogs-new-tricks-and-crappy-newspaper-executives/">leadership to adapt</a> is identified, explained, and disseminated across newsrooms. Digital First is certainly one pathway, but many newsrooms need help even getting to the point of having the Digital First conversation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to say, but I do not have any answers on how this happens. Much has been written about the fact that <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/158767/former-newspaper-editors-regret-not-pushing-for-change-more-aggressively/">culture needs to change</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;how <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/press-room/press-mention/new-knight-study-identifies-3-surprising-keys-nonp/">great it can be when it does change</a>, but I&#39;ve seen far less about how you actually make it happen. Look forward to thoughts and suggestions.</p>
