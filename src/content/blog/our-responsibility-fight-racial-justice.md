<p>I <a href="https://srccon.org/transcripts/SRCCON2017-friday-closing">gave a talk</a> to a couple hundred journalists about our responsibility to each other and our communities. About the ways our experiences shape our work, and our duty, especially as white people, to fight the powerful forces that seek to divide us.</p>

<p>I was able to give this talk for a few reasons. First and foremost is because of the people of color in my life who have been generous in sharing their own experiences and time, and supporting me as I find my way as an ally and activist. Also, shout out to B Cordelia Yu who wordsmithed the closing of my speech and hit on the &quot;pushing for equity in every community we touch&quot; powerful summation.</p>

<p>Talking about racial and economic justice is hard. <a href="/blog/funding-revolution-together">As I&#39;ve learned more</a>, so much of what I understand about equity just feels obvious and like it&#39;s silly to state explicitly. It&#39;s been a challenge to figure out how to talk about things in a way that is respectful and clear and doesn&#39;t oversimplify. My <a href="https://rockwoodleadership.org/art-of-leadership/">experience at Rockwood</a> last year, definitely pushed me to be more direct in talking about the ways a sense of justice drives how I approach my work, and prepared me to make a speech like this.</p>

<p>Part of what I addressed in my talk is our present political moment (and the fact that while it is intense, it is not new). Many of us are questioning whether our current work, whatever it may be, is &quot;enough&quot; given what <a href="http://erikaowens.com/blog/no-more-deportations-we-shall-not-be-moved">threats our neighbors face</a>. I&#39;ve seen a lot of people share thoughts along the lines of &quot;grow where you are planted,&quot; meaning, do what you can where you&#39;re at. This speech, and the many hugs I received just after, helped me see more clearly the wisdom in that advice.</p>

<p>The &quot;is this enough?&quot; worry is extraordinarily hard to shake off. But I know that what I&#39;ve done over the past five years, the processes and values I&#39;ve helped inject into our organization, has helped my friends and colleagues. That the spaces and connections our organization has built have allowed folks, people of color in particular, to feel heard, respected, and supported. That people have stayed in journalism, doing work that better informs and engages their communities, because we ensure that their professional curiosities and personal needs are treated as equally important.</p>

<p>We&#39;re in this struggle together. I&#39;m grateful for the people and organizations that create spaces for us to struggle, grieve, and build our power together.</p>
