I gave a presentation at <a href="http://www.drupaldelphia">Drupaldelphia 2011</a> on <a href="http://www.drupaldelphia.com/sessions/possibilities-civicrm">CiviCRM and an overview of lessons learned</a> from our development process.

In lieu of a PowerPoint, I put together a list of some key resources from when I was researching CRM planning in general and CiviCRM specifically.

<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/deangraham/spreadsheets-to-crm-graham">Dean Graham presentation:&nbsp;Spreadsheets to CRM</a> This is an incredible overview of the CRM implementation process. He estimates that the process takes 4 months to 2 years, and that is totally accurate.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.idealware.org/reports/consumers-guide-low-cost-donor-management-systems">Idealware guide to low-cost donor management</a> A great resource to learn more about the options out there. Page 24 has a great comparison chart</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nten.org/events/webinar/2010/02/22/free-kittens-civicrm-and-salesforce">NTEN&nbsp;webinar comparing Salesforce for nonprofits and CiviCRM</a> After doing this preliminary research, I narrowed down our top choices to CiviCRM and Salesforce, and this webinar clearly lays out the pros and cons of both, from Feb. 2010.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/FatherShawn/drupalcivicrm-out-of-the-box">Overview of CiviCRM slideshare from Father Shawn</a> Good general introduction to CiviCRM</p>

<p><a href="/sites/default/files/NotebookCiviCRM-RFP.pdf" target="_blank">Example RFP, the Notebook</a> Here's our CiviCRM specific RFP. Ignore the timeline, it was extremely unrealistic!</p>
